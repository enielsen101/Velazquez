	<p>

		 Representative Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) was born in Puerto Rico and attended the University of Puerto Rico and New York University. In 1984 she served on the City Council, and in 1992 she became the first Puerto Rican woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She represented New York's 12th Congressional District from 1993 to 2013. Since 2013 she has represented New York’s 7th Congressional District, which covers parts of Brooklyn and Queens. She is the Ranking Member of the House Small Business Committee.

	</p>

	<p>
		 Velazquez’s 16th term in Congress ends on Jan. 3, 2025. She is on the ballot in the general election on Nov. 5, 2024 and will be running against William Kregler (R/Conservative Party). But the Democratic and Working Families Party primaries were canceled because there were no competitors. These are the issues that have been central to Velazquez’s career and where she stands on them.

	<h3>Puerto Rico</h3>

	<p>
		Velazquez is from Puerto Rico and was in part educated there. In December, 2023 she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/puerto-rico-power-outages-economic-impact-rcna157094">introduced</a> a bipartisan bill to require FEMA to address recovery challenges in the U.S. territories. She also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/new-bill-puerto-rico-status-introduced-reps-aoc-vel-zquez-n1261458">introduced</a> the Puerto Rico Status Act, which was co-sponsored by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. The bill allowed for Puerto Rico to choose its determination among three options. That bill passed the house and the senate with bipartisan support and President Biden signed it into law in 2022. In the summer of 2024 Velazquez <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/puerto-rico-power-outages-economic-impact-rcna157094">called</a> on the U.S. Department of Energy to track economic losses due to recurrent power outages on the island.
